# Sauti Marketplace

A Database API that helps users navigate and search for goods they need around their area. This API is comuincatiing with
a third party technology called USSD to help users navigate with the API. **USSD** is Unstructed Supplementary Service Data. 
With this API we will be able to let users have a friendly safe user environment without having any issues with the products
they are trying to buy. 

### Prerequisite 

The reason behind this application is to help buyers find resources they need without needing to travel, cross borders, or 
get scammed from false prices from sellers. It's highly essential for women since women are highly victims of having bad 
experience with marketplaces. If there is a specific ingrediant or item someone is trying to get, they can simply search it 
in our API and will be located to the nearest marketplace to them with the items they are looking for. 

### How are we doing this? 

We are working with a steakholder that already has an existing app that is being used in the real world. But the steakholder 
**believes** that there is a better solution to do this! And that is where we come in! We are creating a full Menu for users 
to access right through their mobile device using via text messages with the help of USSD that is bassically the provider 
for Marketplaces. With this we can come up with a way to simplify the user experience.

## Contributing

We are no experts here and are open to any type of contribution! If you feel like you have some crazy solutions to help us
make this software better and simpiler feel free to fork this repo and code away!
